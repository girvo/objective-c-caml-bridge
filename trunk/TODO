- support for instance variables
	  [target setValue:v forKey:@"fieldname"];
	  what's the type for v? NSValue, NSNumber, NSFoo for other classes?

- calls from ObjC to OCaml
  	inspect invocation
	build array of values
	invoke callback

- look at threads that are not spawned by OCaml - is it possible to
  call some C initialization that would make them tolerable to OCaml?


Next:
  * nil as valid object of any type.
  * better string/NSString passing?
  * dynamic type checking of arguments? (using @encode and such)
  * includes from CoreFoundation
  * NSAffineTransform and NSAttributedString are defined both in Foundation and AppKit...
  * casts:
	  Class: we should have it too?
	  NSDecimal? 20 bytes, not a class
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------
DONE
  * testing: NSError **, NSRange
  DONE * types/injections are wrong for args - need to think that through
  DONE  * group categories into class def
  * factoring of opt args
    * naive version fails sometimes due to different naming of args...; still performs some factoring
    * needs to NOT opt out some arguments if we don't have the shorter selectors
    * problem with return type    (foo)a:  and  (bar)a: are both compiled
  * record typedef enums as equivalent to int
  * release/retain stuff
  * return type w/ encapsulation is not correct?
  * get some simple testing quickly
  * SEL mapping seems to be inconsistent (wrapping/no wrapping)
  * callbacks are unsafe (two params allocs)
  * iron out the first hello world
  * why do we crash with the dynamically linked version (wrong option to camlmklib - use -framework instead 
  of -ccopt -framework
  * return type of class constructor
  * bogus class generation when only categories: no, can't do much cleaning about this
  * inheritance w/ coercion
    		generated coercion is easy
		inheritance?
			inherit (P_of_C o) as super
			but what with the "o" method?

  * sorting of .cmo (using cmosort)
  * debug the dependency graph (ARGS incorrect - no deps, RET incorrect NSObject/NSMethodSignature not reflected)
- bug with no argument selectors (shouldn't have a ":" in the selector name)
- compile categories separately if different from the main class of the .h (e.g. NSObject cats)
- Handling recursive compilation
class native_X = fun id -> object ... end
and native_Y = fun id -> object ... end
...
module NSFoo = struct
 let c = object ... end
 class t = object inherit native_NSFoo inherit NSObject end
end
	- Very good, but it does not compile...
	- ? look into more precise dependency data, e.g. between classes only (and not class objects?)
	- ? compiles better if we remove inheritance on NSObject.
	- we can do multiple inh later - wrapping will be incomplete though 
	(doesn't generate the proper classes)
	- transitive closure on dependencies of classes going to "share"
	- would it be easire to cut the dependencies all together??

- separate out Makefiles for foundation/appkit (some duplicate naming)
- inheritance
- doover for method naming convention
  The whole idea of using labelled args for multiple variations of ObjC messages doesn't work
  very well - it only supports the case where some arguments can be omitted. Unfortunately,
  the various Cocoa API make use of overloading quite a bit (e.g. same primary selector foo: 
  with multiple different secondary selectors, foo:a: foo:b: foo:c:d).
  Instead, we're going to be dump and if the selector is foo:a:, then the method name in OCaml
  will be foo_a_.
- NSPoint, NSSize, NSRect unit testing (use NSScreen?)
