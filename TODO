Next:
  * testing: NSError **, NSRange
  * enum values
  * better naming convention? (NSFoo.nsclass for default?)
  * nil as valid object of any type.
  * better string/NSString passing?
  * inheritance w/ coercion
  * dynamic type checking of arguments? (using @encode and such)
  * includes from CoreFoundation
  * NSAffineTransform and NSAttributedString are defined both in Foundation and AppKit...
  * casts:
    	  NSComparisonResult: enum, builtin at low level
	  SEL: we have it already
	  NSTimeInverval
	  Class: we should have it too?
	  NSExpressionType
	  NSRange: need to hardcode
	  NSDecimal? 20 bytes, not a class
	  NSPoint, NSSize, NSRect
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------
DONE
  DONE * types/injections are wrong for args - need to think that through
  DONE  * group categories into class def
  * factoring of opt args
    * naive version fails sometimes due to different naming of args...; still performs some factoring
    * needs to NOT opt out some arguments if we don't have the shorter selectors
    * problem with return type    (foo)a:  and  (bar)a: are both compiled
  * record typedef enums as equivalent to int
  * release/retain stuff
  * return type w/ encapsulation is not correct?
  * get some simple testing quickly
  * SEL mapping seems to be inconsistent (wrapping/no wrapping)
  * callbacks are unsafe (two params allocs)
  * iron out the first hello world
  * why do we crash with the dynamically linked version (wrong option to camlmklib - use -framework instead 
  of -ccopt -framework
  * return type of class constructor
